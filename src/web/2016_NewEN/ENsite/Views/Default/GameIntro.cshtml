                        L coins are game coins in Lucky Table, and can be divided into Gold Coins and Silver Coins. Both Gold Coins and Silver Coins can be bet in most game machines, but some machines can only use Gold Coins to bet.<br />
                        When you bet with Gold coins, coins will be added or deducted from the Gold Coins account balance. Likewise, when you bet with Silver Coins, coins will be added or deducted from the Silver Coins account balance.<br />
